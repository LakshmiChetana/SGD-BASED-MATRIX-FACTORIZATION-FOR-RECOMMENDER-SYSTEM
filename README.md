# SGD-BASED-MATRIX-FACTORIZATION-FOR-RECOMMENDER-SYSTEM


Abstract:

Collaborative filtering is a most common recommendation technique that
recommends items to the users based on previous history and items liked by user.
Sparsity is one of the problem of collaborative filtering technique which brings about
challenges in the performances of recommendation. Matrix factorization is a class of
collaborative filtering algorithms used in recommender systems for decomposing the
user item interaction. Matrix Factorization is a model that performs well on sparse
and imbalanced datase ts for making better predictions for users using few ratings. We
introduce a constrained version of the model by using the optimizer called Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD), which is commonly used for factorizing large matrices. The
word stochastic means a system or a process that is linked with a random probability.
Hence, in Stochastic Gradient Descent, a few samples are selected randomly instead
of the whole data set for each iteration. SGD based factorization has proven to be the
most successful among these methods after Netflix and KDDCUP competitions. In
SGD, we find out the gradient of the cost function of a single example at each
iteration instead of the sum of the gradient of the cost function of all the examples.
